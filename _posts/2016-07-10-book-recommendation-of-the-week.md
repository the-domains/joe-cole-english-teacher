# **The Man Who Loved China**

## By Simon Winchester

## During the Japanese invasion of China in the previous century, universities were one of the great institutes that were under attack. Joseph Needham, a British scientist with a deep affinity with China and a sympathy for socialism, was chosen to travel through the land to figure out how best to help the struggling academics. He did so heroically, traveling to every free province, meeting impressive people wherever he went, and bestowing huge resources where they were needed. He quickly became loved by the Chinese people, who thought of him as a kind of Santa Claus.

## While exploring, he was intrigued by the way the locals did things differently, and with a bit of research discovered that a lot of the world's greatest inventions, like the abacus, the compass and the straddle for horses were created first in China, not Europe as was widely believed in the west. So, collecting tons of books and essays on almost every topic, he began work on an Encyclopaedia called Science and Civilisation in China, which would become one of the greatest works of scientific research ever made. A massive collection of knowledge proving the huge impact China has had on the world.

## As a British man in Guangzhou, I am privileged to receive the highest courtesy from the local people, and maybe this book helps to explain why. Fascinating!
