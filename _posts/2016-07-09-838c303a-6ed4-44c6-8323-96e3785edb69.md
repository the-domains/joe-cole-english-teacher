  Hello, you. Welcome to my website. I’m Joe, an English teacher in Guangzhou.
  I’m a freelance, well-trained teacher with a degree in English and a teacher’s
  license. I have worked in big schools and universities in China for the last
  four years, and I have experience teaching business English and preparing
  students for exams like IELTS, TOEFL, SATs, BEC, and so on. I taught really
  young children in my first year, so I know how to use simple words to help you
  understand. If you have a specific goal, or you just want to improve your
  general English, I’m your guy.
