# Me

## Hello readers.

## This is a little blog style website about me and the projects I do. My name's Joe and I'm an English teacher. I've been teaching in Guangzhou for four years now, and I'm absolutely loving it.

## I teach the full spectrum of student types and class styles, from one-to-one conversation practice with 60-year-olds to chaotic business writing seminars with 70+ university undergrads, from professional workshops for hotels and service companies, to phonics basics with three-year-olds. Maybe I'm a jack of all trades, which I'm quite happy about at this stage of my career.

## This website is going to track the work I do in some of my more interesting projects.
