  Hello, you. Welcome to my website. I’m Joe, an English teacher in Guangzhou.
  I’m a freelance, well-trained teacher with a degree in English and a teacher’s
  license. I have worked in big schools and universities in China for the last
  four years, and I have experience teaching business English and preparing
  students for exams. I taught really young children in my first year, so I know
  how to use simple words to help you understand. If you have a goal, or you
  just want to get better at English, I’m your guy.
