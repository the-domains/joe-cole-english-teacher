# **About Me**

Hello, you. Welcome to my website. I'm an English teacher at Guangdong Polytechnic Normal University, but I do other things too. I'm keen on weekend workshop events and weekly activity groups, such as the public speech club I founded last year at GPNU. If you would like a private class with me, just send me a quick message.

I'm a passionate, creative mind, dedicated to the promotion of a braver kind of ESL. The courses I provide and the projects I work on are always ambitious, bold, enterprising, practical, colourful, meticulously planned, absorbing and utterly memorable. I believe that true English learning comes from delving deeper, specialising, and immersing oneself in fascinating topics. That is why I'm constantly striving to bring applied learning to my students in new and exciting ways. My goal is to pull back the curtains and show the world what exists beyond the ESL classroom.

Having taught English in China for four years, I've gained a good understanding of the challenges that face adult English learners. You have specific goals in your life, and you need specific language skills to achieve them. I pay close attention to where you want to go. Then, I give you the skill set you'll need to get there. That's what I do; it's who I am.

My mission in everything I do is "to teach and empower". I stress that word, empower, because I know you've got places to go. You don't just need English; you need strength - to blast through barriers and leap over tall mountains. And you haven't got all day!

This website is to help me promote my own brand of ESL. Use it to find out what I've been up to, but also to stay informed of the exciting events that are coming up. If you are interested in having class with me, or you'd like more information about one of the activities, please contact me.
