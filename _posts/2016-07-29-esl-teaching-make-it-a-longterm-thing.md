**ESL Teaching - Make It a Longterm Thing**

In many minds, ESL (English as a Second Language) teachers are transient backpackers with little or no credentials. We are young and free, chasing thrills, chasing experience, and escaping from the sad fact that we do not have extraordinary lives waiting for us at home. We are adored and romanticized for the hedonistic freedom we represent, but we are also thought of as uneducated, unambitious and unsuccessful. At worst, we are philanderers, drunks and jokers.

This stereotype was established years ago when the first wave of gap year students flocked to places afar to see the world... and also do a bit of teaching. The ESL industry, with its paint-by-numbers, ready-made lesson plans, and flight-home bonus for contract completion, is geared almost exclusively towards this kind of person. The downside is that the same conveyor belt system is set up to exploit teaching staff with low salaries (comparative to earnings) and high working hours. Backpackers dreaming of adventure and money are in for a rude awakening.

But there is a new type of ESL teacher emerging -- the career teacher. Think of a country that sees English as an essential language but has terrible infrastructure in place to teach it, a country with newfound wealth and a desire to invest a large part of it on education, a country in which 90% of your competitors are unqualified and uncommitted, and you will begin to see a country where opportunity is rife. The career teacher is set on grasping this situation by the horns.

With four years of experience working in English training centers for adults and children, universities, and as a freelance home tutor, I have learned a few things, and I'd like to pass them on to you. If you are new to this profession, or find yourself in one of the many dead-end teaching jobs out there, I hope this guide will help you reach your potential as an ESL educator.

**1) Get out of the training centers**

Training centers are very welcoming when you are new to the country. Good ones will provide you with all the support you need to hit the ground running. They are not, however, going to give you the time or money you need to fulfill any of your dreams, and they can quickly become uninspiring dungeons. The salary offered may at first seem pretty good, but that's the ceiling for the rest of your career. Can you see yourself starting a family and buying a house with that kind of money? As soon as you have the experience and the connections you need to make it on your own, get the hell out of there. Universities, examining bodies and freelance jobs are much, much better options for an experienced teacher, with higher potential earnings to boot.

**2) Specialize and create**

You will be hired as a 'foreign _expert_.' That means you were hired because you are a fluent English speaker. Moreover, it means that there are roughly 300 million people in the world who could potentially take your job if you left. That doesn't make you very valuable. However, if you are an English teacher who can teach a specific discipline, your value shoots up. Think about creating your own ESL courses for whatever your university major was, for example, and look for people who want to learn it. Do not say yes to jobs that are not in your area of expertise, because that will prevent you from doing a more fitting job. Having a specialty will make you less replaceable, more worthy of a high price, and people will be more likely to recommend you to others.

**3) Keep learning**

With the extra free time you have now that you're not working nonstop at the training center, you can afford to spend a bit of it on developing yourself. An expert teacher is an expert learner. The only way you can dramatically increase your value is through education. Learning to speak the native language and seeking more teaching qualifications are obvious ways to boost your employability. Other ways are to learn more things, through self-study, that could help your students, such as business and finance, or writing skills. A couple of years ago, I decided to learn everything I could about parenting and school curriculums, for example, and that made me the go-to teacher for Chinese parents of international school children in my area.

**4) Build your own brand**

By specializing and educating yourself, you are effectively building your own brand, but you've got to market yourself, too, if you want anybody to know the great service you provide. Put yourself out there. Do content marketing on your own website and social networking sites like LinkedIn to get the word out. Join groups and find side projects, and publish everything you're involved in, creating a kind of online résumé. Having a quiet week? Do some event marketing -- a nice free English corner will be a great way to show others what you can do. Make sure you are the first teacher people think of when they are searching for one.

**5) Make it a long-term thing**

The industry is bogged down with fleeting teachers who come and go. Simply taking your job seriously and sticking it out will give you a massive advantage. The rewards are huge for anyone passionate enough about ESL teaching to make a career of it.
