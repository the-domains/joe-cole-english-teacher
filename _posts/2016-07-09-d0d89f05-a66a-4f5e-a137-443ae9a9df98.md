Every Friday at 5:30pm during the school semester, the GPNU Public Speaking Club gets together to practice their oral English. 

This is a group I set up a year ago with the help of Christine, pictured clapping her hands just behind me. 

Since its humble beginnings, the club has evolved into a beautiful thing. It makes me proud to see a nervous and timid student blossom into a powerful speaker - something that happens regularly here!
