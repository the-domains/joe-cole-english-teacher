# **GPNU Public Speaking Club**

Every Friday during term time, passionate students at Guangdong Polytechnic Normal University get together to participate in a public speaking workshop. The aim is to develop public speaking skills and strategies while simultaneously practicing the English language. Due to large class size in their regular course, students don't often get the chance to speak out, so this is an opportunity they relish.

I founded the club one year ago with the help of a small group of students, and I am delighted with the progress we have made in such a short time. One of my personal goals during the first year was to hand over my organising responsibilities to other students, as I envisioned a club that fosters leadership amongst other things. It took a while for this to happen, but happen it did, and what a positive effect it has had on our club! Students are now more engaged and the events are more varied. 

My goal for next year is to introduce more structured competition, with the hope that it will encourage the members to engage more actively and more regularly. Inter-school competitions could also be of interest to our university's high calibre English speakers. I would like people to wear the PSC t-shirt with pride.
